# Music Dataset Exploration

## Project Overview
This is my first machine learning project where I explore a dataset combining Spotify audio features and YouTube engagement data for over 20,000 songs. The goal is to understand music characteristics and how they relate to popularity.

## What You Will Find
- Distribution of key audio features like energy, danceability, and valence  
- Correlations between musical features  
- Top artists and tracks by energy and positivity  
- Differences in audio features between popular and other tracks based on YouTube views  
- Relations between instrumentalness, acousticness, tempo, and duration  
- Summary of album types and dataset diversity  

## Usage
Open the `music_dataset_exploration.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and run cells step-by-step. It includes comments and conclusions after each analysis to guide you.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  

Install dependencies using:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn


## What I Learned
- Loading and cleaning data  
- Visualizing feature distributions and correlations  
- Performing artist and track analysis  
- Comparing popular tracks using YouTube data  
- Writing clear conclusions after analyses  

## Future Work
- Adding release dates and genres for temporal and categorical trends  
- Experimenting with machine learning models for prediction
